## steps taken:

- Make Github rep;
- Read about virtual environment;
- Create virtual environment;
- Activate virtual environment;
- Read about libraries for handling geospatial data;
- Install geopandas and dependencies in virtual environment;
- Import libraries in Jupyter lab;
- Learn how to handle shapefiles;
- Read about DSM and DTM;
- Download the files that corresponds with Bruges from geopunt.be;
- Learn how to handle Geotiff files;
- Learn how to 3D plot;
- Windowed reading via Rasterio;
- Save window to .tif file ;
- Transform nd array into dataframe;
- 3D surface plot dataframe with Matplotlib;
- Learn how to use Plotly (via Jupiter Notebook not with Jupyter Lab (doesn't work));
- Reprojection in Rasterio (does not work due to library issues);
- Transform coordinates with Piproj ;
- Write a program that takes DMS and converts into Decimals and Belgian Lambert '72;
- Continue with the program so it plots a location in Bruges in 3D;
- Finished writing a script that asks the user to give in DMS for Northing and Easting, transforms them into latitude and longitude and asks the user to choose a library to 3D-plot the location;
- Try making a GUI with Dash and Flask (work in progress: not finished). The link: http://ndemuynck.pythonanywhere.com (allows the user to convert DMS into decimals. The interface is 3 boxes: one for degrees (int), minutes (int) and seconds (float);
- Customizing the Plotly 3D-plot;
- Customizing the Matplotlib 3D-plot;
- Reverse the dataframe so the 3D-plot is shown correct. (Not mirrored).
